## **🔧 Components Used**

### **Amazon S3**
- Stores uploaded `.txt` files  
- Triggers Lambda on `PUT` events  
- Uses suffix filtering to only process `.txt` files  

### **AWS Lambda (Python 3.10)**
- Reads the uploaded file from S3  
- Counts the number of words  
- Publishes the result to SNS  
- Logs execution details to CloudWatch  

### **Amazon SNS**
- Sends email notifications with the word count  
- Requires subscription confirmation  

### **Amazon CloudWatch Logs**
- Captures Lambda execution logs  
- Used for debugging and validation  

---

## **🚀 End‑to‑End Workflow**

1. User uploads a `.txt` file to the S3 bucket  
2. S3 triggers the Lambda function  
3. Lambda:
   - Downloads the file  
   - Counts the words  
   - Publishes the result to SNS  
4. SNS sends an email notification  
5. CloudWatch Logs record the entire execution

## **🛠️ Troubleshooting (Real Issues Solved)**

### **1. SNS InvalidParameterException**
**Cause:** SNS Topic ARN was not wrapped in quotes  
**Fix:**
```python
SNS_TOPIC_ARN = "arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:XXXXXXXXXXXX:WordCountTopic"
```

---

### **2. S3 Trigger Not Firing**
**Cause:** `.txt` was placed in the *prefix* field instead of *suffix*  
**Fix:**  
- Leave **Prefix** empty  
- Set **Suffix** to `.txt`  
- Check the recursive invocation acknowledgment box  

---

### **3. KeyError: 'Records'**
**Cause:** Lambda was manually tested using the “Test” button  
**Fix:**  
Only test by uploading a file to S3 — Lambda expects an S3 event structure.

---

### **4. SyntaxError in Lambda**
**Cause:** Missing quotes around the SNS ARN  
**Fix:**  
Wrap the ARN in quotes (Python requires strings).

---

### **5. No Email Received**
**Possible causes:**
- SNS subscription not confirmed  
- SNS ARN incorrect  
- Lambda error before publish  

**Fix:**  
Check CloudWatch logs for SNS errors and confirm subscription.

## **📚 What I Learned**

- How to build an event‑driven architecture using AWS managed services  
- How S3 event notifications trigger Lambda functions  
- How Lambda interacts with S3 and SNS using IAM permissions  
- How to debug Lambda using CloudWatch Logs  
- How to interpret common AWS errors (syntax, ARN issues, event structure)  
- How to design clean, modular serverless workflows  
- How to validate and test cloud automation end‑to‑end  

This project strengthened my understanding of serverless compute, event triggers, and cloud‑native automation patterns.
